Of course I did, but if you get the chance to (early) access [@AtomicJarInc](https://twitter.com/AtomicJarInc)'s testcontainers cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è you should not hesitate to do so!

            So, I've been using [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains) gateway for about a month, no (because they didn't give me [@JetBrains_Fleet](https://twitter.com/JetBrains_Fleet)), however what Gateway can do is crazy, you notice that it is still a beta and I have been creating lots of YouTrack issues, but it's amazing

          I used [@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains) Gateway only briefly but I can already see it's the future of development. 
          
          Most of us work on laptops but need to run multiple servers/containers just to locally develop some applications.
          
          [@testcontainers](https://twitter.com/testcontainers) Cloud is another great example!

          Got an exciting [@micronautfw](https://twitter.com/micronautfw) spike working:
          1. start a build
          2. runs tests which require a MySQL server
          3. let Testcontainers Cloud spawn a container
          4. let tests run in JVM mode
          5. build a native image of the tests
          6. run them against the same container

Ever since [@quarkusio](https://twitter.com/QuarkusIO) introduced devservices that uses [@testcontainers](https://twitter.com/testcontainers) I‚Äôve wondered how we could make it available for users without the machine power or even access to docker.
