## Q&A
### What were your first experiences with Testcontainers?
My first memorable experience was introducing Testcontainers to a customer and massively improving the feedback loop.  My default “integration” environment moved away from fully deployed services, towards Testcontainers.  Testcontainers became an essential tool for me during my time at Redis.

### What’s your favourite Testcontainers module?
Redis, RabbitMQ and Yugabyte

### What are your favourite features for Testcontainers?
Integration testing is an easier muscle to build.

### What’s the most memorable bug you managed to reproduce with a test using Testcontainers?
The day that I uninstalled Redis, MySQL and Postgres from my dev machine.  A short time later, the day that I updated my pipelines to use Testcontainers in integration.
