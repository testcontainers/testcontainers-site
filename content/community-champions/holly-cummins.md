## Bio
Holly Cummins is a Senior Principal Software Engineer on the Red Hat Quarkus team. Holly really really likes Quarkus, and also really really likes Testcontainers. 

Before joining Red Hat, Holly was a long time IBMer, in a range of roles from cloud consultant, full-stack javascript developer, WebSphere Liberty devops architect, JVM performance engineer, to innovation leader. Holly led projects for enormous banks, tiny startups, and everything in between. 

Holly has used the power of cloud to understand climate risks, count fish, help a blind athlete run ultra-marathons in the desert solo, and invent stories (although not at all the same time). 

Holly is also a Java Champion, author, and regular keynote speaker. You can follow her on twitter at [@holly_cummins](https://twitter.com/holly_cummins), mastodon at [@holly_cummins@hachyderm.io](https://mastodon.social/@holly_cummins), or at [hollycummins.com](hollycummins.com).

## Q&A
### What were your first experiences with Testcontainers?
I was aware of Testcontainers, but hadn't used them personally until I started working on Quarkus. Quarkus has a deep integration with Testcontainers, so I ended up learning Testcontainers and Quarkus at the same time.

### Whatâ€™s your favourite Testcontainers module?
I use the postgresql testcontainer all the time.

### What are your favourite features for Testcontainers?
It's great how there are pre-defined Testcontainers modules, but users can also bring their own container.
