## Q&A
### What were your first experiences with Testcontainers?
I started using Testcontainers back in 2018 by improving test suites for applications using Kafka and Kafka Streams.

### What’s your favourite Testcontainers module?
My own Artifactory one.

### What are your favourite features for Testcontainers?
Easiness to create custom containers, reusable containers and Testcontainers Cloud.

### What’s the most memorable bug you managed to reproduce with a test using Testcontainers?
Not really addressing a bug, but the ability to create my own testcontainer that could spin up a real Artifactory has helped me to make build/package/publish changes in Gradle machinery with confidence and deliver new features to hundreds of engineers.
