Oracle XE, Mysql, postgresql

### What are your favourite features for Testcontainers?
Ryuk

### What’s the most memorable bug you managed to reproduce with a test using Testcontainers?
It wasn’t a bug. It was a creative way of using Testcontainers to verify that we hadn’t broken the database with each schema migration.
