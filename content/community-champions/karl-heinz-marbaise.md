## Bio
Chairman of the Apache Maven Project, Apache Software Foundation Member, Mojo Haus Member, Java Developer, CI / CD Fan, Freelancer. I've developed in C, C++, Object Pascal, Perl, PHP, Basic and assembly language (long time ago ;-)). 

I'm working with Java since 2005 and started to use Apache Maven for building (some times I've used Apache Ant). 

For testing I'm using JUnit Jupiter, TestNG, Mockito, AssertJ and of course Testcontainers and containers in general. And not to forget things like PITest, SonarQube, Spotless etc. On the side of the infrastructure Jenkins, Nexus, Git (in the earlier times also SVN), Gitea, Github or alike. Got in contact with Go language to solve some specific tooling problems. 

During the Java application development I used Spring Boot and it's ecosystem to develop different kinds of application. Doing also a number of different conferences like JCon Europe, BaselOne, FOSDEM etc. 

Doing a number traings for customers about Maven, Git, Jenkins (CI/CD) etc.

## Q&A
### What were your first experiences with Testcontainers?
I started using Testcontainers ca. 2018 while having the need to build End-To-End tests with a complicate application setup (Spring Boot) where Testcontainers helped to solve that in relationship with JUnit Jupiter (based on the extenions mechanism).

### Whatâ€™s your favourite Testcontainers module?
Image: gvenzl/oracle-xe, sonarqube, gitea

### What are your favourite features for Testcontainers?
To be able to integrate a full application within a container into your tests.
