# Getting Started
## What is Testcontainers?
Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping local development and test dependencies with real services wrapped in Docker containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests talking to the same type of services you use in production without mocks or in-memory services.
