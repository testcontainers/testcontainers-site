Modern software systems tackle complex business problems by leveraging various technologies and tools.
Nowadays, hardly any software system works in isolation; they usually talk to databases, messaging systems, and cache providers
and interact with many other 3rd party services. In todayâ€™s highly competitive market, time-to-market is crucial.
Businesses want to put their product on the market as soon as possible, get feedback and iterate on it.
To achieve that agility, one should have a solid Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process.
A crucial part of the CI/CD process is automated testing to ensure the correctness of the application behavior.

While Unit Testing helps in testing the business logic by isolating the external services like databases, messaging systems etc.,
the bulk of the application logic may still be in integrating with those external services.
To be fully confident with our application, we should also write integration tests
along with unit tests to ensure that our application is fully functional.

Historically Integration testing is considered difficult because of the challenges in maintaining an "integration testing environment".
Integration testing with pre-provisioned infrastructure is challenging because of the following reasons:

* Before running tests, you must ensure that the infrastructure is up and running and data is pre-configured in a specific desired state.
* If multiple build pipelines run parallelly, then one test execution might interfere with other test data resulting in flaky tests.

Due to the challenges mentioned above, some people lean towards using services with in-memory or embedded variations of the required services for integration testing. For example, if an application uses the Postgres database, then H2 in-memory database is used for testing. While this is an improvement over not writing integration tests at all, using mock or in-memory versions of those services brings its own problems:

* In-memory services may not have all the features of your production service. For example, you might be using advanced features of Postgres/Oracle databases in your application. But H2 might not support all those features in order to use it for integration testing.
* In-memory services delay the feedback cycle. For example, you might have written an SQL query and tested it with an H2 in-memory database which is working fine. But after deploying the application, you may realize the query syntax works fine for H2 but not with your production database Postgres/Oracle. This kind of testing effectively defeats the purpose of testing, which is to get faster feedback cycles.

Now, welcome to the wonderful world of Testcontainers, where integration testing with real services is not only possible but also as easy as writing unit tests ðŸ™‚

== What is Testcontainers?

Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping integration tests with real services wrapped in docker containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests talking to the same type of services you use in production without mocks or in-memory services.

A typical Testcontainers-based integration test works as follows:

* Before Test:
    ** Start your required services (databases, messaging systems etc.) docker containers using Testcontainers API.
    ** Configure or update your application configuration to use these containerized services.
* During Test:
    ** Your tests will run using these containerized services.
* After Test:
    ** Testcontainers will take care of destroying those containers irrespective of whether tests executed successfully or there are any test failures.

The only requirement to run Testcontainers-based tests is to have a Docker-API compatible container runtime. If you have Docker Desktop installed and running, you are good to go. For more information on Testcontainers supporting Docker environments refer https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/ .

== What problems do Testcontainers solve?
Testcontainers solve the integration testing problems mentioned above  by enabling us to test our application using real services and thereby increasing the confidence level on our code changes.

By using Testcontainers:

* You donâ€™t need to have a pre-provisioned integration testing infrastructure. Testcontainers API will provide the required services before running our tests.
* There will be no data conflict issues even when multiple build pipelines run in parallel because each pipeline runs with an isolated set of services.
* You can run your integration tests right from your IDE, just like you run unit tests. No need to push your changes and wait for CI to run your integration tests.
* After test execution, Testcontainers take care of cleaning up the containers automatically.

== A first look at Testcontainers

You can use Testcontainers with many popular programming languages, including Java, .NET, Go, NodeJS, Rust, and Python, and more language support is on the way.

Let us look at how we can use Testcontainers for testing a Java application using the Postgres database.

=== 1. Create a Java project with Maven

Create a Java project with Maven build tool support from your favorite IDE. We are using Maven in this article, but you can use Gradle if you prefer.
Once the project is created, add the following dependencies to pom.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
       <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
       <version>42.5.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
       <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
       <version>1.4.5</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
       <version>5.9.2</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
   <plugins>
       <plugin>
           <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
           <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
           <version>3.0.0-M6</version>
       </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
----

We have added Postgres JDBC driver for talking to Postgresql database, logback-classic for logging and junit-jupiter for testing with JUnit 5. Also, we have used the latest version of maven-surefire-plugin to support JUnit 5 tests.

=== 2. Implement business logic
We are going to create a simple CustomerService class to manage customer details. First let us create a Customer class as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/Customer.java[]
----

Create CustomerService.java class and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerService.java[]
----

In CustomerService class we have:

* getConnection() method which gets database connection properties from System Properties and creates a Database Connection using JDBC API
* createCustomersTableIfNotExists() method creates customers table.
* createCustomer() method inserts a new customer record into the database.
* getAllCustomers() method fetches all rows from customers table, populates data into Customer objects and returns a list of Customer objects.

Now let us see how we can test CustomerService logic using Testcontainers.

=== 3. Add Testcontainers dependencies
Before writing Testcontainers based tests letâ€™s add Testcontainers dependencies in pom.xml as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
   <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
   <version>1.17.6</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

As we are using Postgres database for our application, we added Testcontainers postgresql module as a test dependency.

=== 4. Write test using Testcontainers
Create CustomerServiceTest.java under src/test/java with following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerServiceTest.java[]
----


Let us understand the code in our CustomerServiceTest.

* We declared PostgreSQLContainer by passing the docker image name postgres:15-alpine.
* The postgres container is started using JUnit 5 @BeforeAll callback, which gets executed before running any test methods.
* In the same callback method, we have retrieved database connection properties from the container instance and configured them as System Properties. CustomerService will use these System Properties to establish a database connection.
* We have created a CustomerService instance in @BeforeEach callback method, which gets executed before running every test method. In the CustomerService constructor, we are creating the customers table if it does not already exist.
* We have a shouldGetCustomers() test where we are inserting 2 customer records into the database, fetching all the existing customers and asserting the number of customers.
* Finally, we are stopping the postgres container in @AfterAll callback method, which gets executed after all the test methods in that class are executed.

If you run the CustomerServiceTest you can see in the logs that Postgres docker image is pulled from DockerHub if not already available locally, started the container and executed the test.

Voila!!! You have your first Testcontainers-based test running.

== Conclusion

We have explored the challenges with integration testing and understood why testing with mocks or in-memory services is not a good idea. Then we talked about how Testcontainers solves the integration testing problem and enables us to test with real services. Finally, we get hands-on experience using the Java Testcontainers library for testing a Java application using the Postgres database.

We have seen how writing an integration test using Testcontainers is very similar to writing a unit test which you can test right from your IDE. Also, any of your teammates can clone the project and run tests without installing Postgres on their computers.

In addition to Postgres, Testcontainers provides dedicated modules to many commonly used SQL databases, NoSQL databases, messaging queues, etc. You can use Testcontainers to run any containerized service for your tests.
