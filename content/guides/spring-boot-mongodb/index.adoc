This quick starter will guide you to configure and use https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] in a SpringBoot project.

In this guide, we'll look at a sample Spring Boot application that uses Testcontainers for running unit tests with real dependencies.
The implementation uses MongoDB for storing data. We'll look at the necessary parts of the code that integrates Testcontainers into the app.

After the quick start, you'll have a working Spring Boot app with Testcontainers-based tests,
and will be ready to explore integrations with other databases and other technologies via Testcontainers.

== Setup Environment
Make sure you have Java 8+ and a https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/[compatible Docker environment] installed.
If you are going to use Maven build tool then make sure Java 17+ is installed.

For example:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "17.0.4" 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8, mixed mode, sharing)

$ docker version
...
Server: Docker Desktop 4.12.0 (85629)
 Engine:
  Version:          20.10.17
  API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.17.11
...
----

== Add Testcontainers Dependencies
Following are the Testcontainers and RestAssured dependencies:

[source,groovy]
----
ext {
    set('testcontainersVersion', "1.17.6")
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter'
    testImplementation 'org.testcontainers:mongodb'
    testImplementation 'io.rest-assured:rest-assured'
}

dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom "org.testcontainers:testcontainers-bom:${testcontainersVersion}"
    }
}
----

== Application Entrypoint Class
[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/sivalabs/demo/ProductController.java[lines="10..21"]
----

== Integration Test

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/sivalabs/demo/DemoApplicationTests.java[]
----

== Conclusion
Testcontainers enable using the real dependency services like SQL databases, NoSQL data-stores, message brokers or any containerized services for that matter.
This approach allows you to create reliable test suites improving confidence in your code.
