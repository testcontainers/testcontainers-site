    title: Debug your Testcontainers-powered dependencies

      The app lets you proxy any service to a fixed port to easily inspect it with your favorite debugging tools. For example, inspect a datastore with your IDE plugin, or manage a Kubernetes cluster with k9s. You can even freeze a service to prevent its shutdown so you can debug it.
