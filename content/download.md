      Testcontainers libraries map the containerâ€™s ports onto random ports on the host machine to avoid conflicts, ensuring that automated tests run reliably. With the Testcontainers desktop app, you can also [proxy each service to a fixed port](https://newsletter.testcontainers.com/announcements/set-fixed-ports-to-easily-debug-development-services). This makes it easy to connect your favorite debugging tools, such as an IDE plugin to inspect a datastore, or k9s to manage a Kubernetes cluster.
